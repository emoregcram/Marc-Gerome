SDG 1: No Poverty üåç
Sustainable Development Goal 1 (SDG 1) aims to end poverty in all its forms everywhere. It is the first of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations in 2015, focusing on ensuring access to basic needs and reducing inequalities to create a more equitable world.

Why SDG 1 Matters
Global Impact: More than 700 million people worldwide still live in extreme poverty, surviving on less than $1.90 a day.
Basic Needs: SDG 1 addresses critical issues such as lack of access to food, shelter, education, and healthcare.
Empowerment: By tackling poverty, this goal helps empower marginalized populations and improve their quality of life.
